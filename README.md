# Ultimate Rust Configuration Editor

A suite of powerful, client-side web tools designed to simplify editing your Rust configuration files. Make complex changes to your game settings, keybinds, and favorite servers through an intuitive graphical interface, all without leaving your browser.

**Your privacy is paramount:** All file processing is done locally on your computer. Your configuration files are never uploaded to any server.

## Features

The hub provides three powerful, purpose-built editors:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Game Settings Editor (`client.cfg`)
Expose and edit advanced settings normally buried in the console.

*   **Visual Editor:** Manipulate hundreds of game variables with sliders, dropdowns, and toggles.
*   **Easy Navigation:** Settings are grouped by category for clarity.
*   **Quick Search:** Instantly find any setting by its name or description.
*   **Smart Snap:** A helper tool to easily snap slider values to sensible increments.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keybind Editor (`keys.cfg`)
Build the perfect control scheme without ever opening the console.

*   **Visual Keyboard:** See all your current binds and potential conflicts at a glance.
*   **Advanced Command Builder:** Create complex actions (crafting queues, chat messages, toggles) without manual typing.
*   **Robust Parsing:** Handles even complex, multi-command binds correctly.
*   **Conflict Detection:** Automatically highlights keys bound to multiple actions.

### ‚≠ê Favorite Servers Editor (`favorites.cfg`)
Manage your list of favorite servers with ease.

*   **Simple CRUD:** Easily add, edit, and delete servers from your list.
*   **Sort & Filter:** Organize your server list by name, date added, or use the search bar to find a specific server instantly.
*   **JSON Export:** Copy your server list as a clean JSON object for backup or sharing.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the [**live editor site**](https://jlaiii.github.io/Ultimate-Rust-cfg-Editor/).
2.  Choose the editor you wish to use (e.g., "Keybind Editor").
3.  Locate your Rust `cfg` folder. This is typically found at:
    ```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rust\cfg\
    ```
4.  Drag and drop the corresponding file (`client.cfg`, `keys.cfg`, or `favorites.cfg`) onto the web page.
5.  Use the interface to make your desired changes.
6.  Click the "Download" or "Export" button to save your modified file.
7.  Replace the original file in your `cfg` folder with the one you just downloaded. **It's a good idea to back up your original file first!**
